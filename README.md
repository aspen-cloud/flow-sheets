# Overview

Aspen is a no-code data analysis platform designed to be as easy and familiar as Excel and as powerful as a Python/Jupyter notebook.

# FAQ

## Is Flower right for me?

If you find yourself frequently using Vlookup, Xlookup, Index, Match, etc in Excel, Flower can make joining tables much easier.

If you are considering writing a script in Python, Node, Bash, etc to transform some data that will be reused by others on your team then Flower can make it much easier for your non-programming colleagues to use and understand your program.

If you want to quickly and collaboratively explore a set of data to answer questions like "What is the average salary in our London office?" or "Who from our survey indicated they used MacOS _and_ used Microsoft Edge", then Flower is probably the fastest and easiest way to figure that out.

## How does Flower compare to Excel, SQL, etc?

# Contribution Guide

We're thrilled to have external contributors so don't hesitate to create an Issue or open a Pull Request. We don't have formal guidelines just yet but we plan to formalize a process after the first few contributions.

### Bug Fixes

We don't follow a strict versioned release process and release frequently. So if you discover a bug, make a PR or file an issue and it will be live on our domain within a few minutes of merging into Main.

### Submitting new Node Types

We plan to support hundreds if not thousands of types of Nodes; however, our currently architecture would not handle that well. Don't let that discourage you if you have an idea for a Node ‚Äî we just might not be able to include right away until we iron out our dynamic node inclusion system.
